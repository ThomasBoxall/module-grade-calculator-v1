# Module Grade Calculator (v1)

This app calculates the module based on the mark achieved in each assessment and the weightings of the assessments.

It was my first app written using Dart with the Flutter Framework, so procede with Caution.

I completely rebuilt this app for a module in the second year of my Degree - see [ThomasBoxall/module-grade-calculator-v2](https://github.com/ThomasBoxall/module-grade-calculator-v2) for that!

## Usage
Make sure that flutter is installed and up-to-date by running:
`flutter upgrade --force`

Then run the app with:
`flutter run`

## To-Do
- Clean up code 
- Better document code
- Add assessment type indicator which adds a suitable icon to the left of ListTile (see https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ListTile-class.html)

### Long-term ideas
- Add a way to 'load' assessments (eg have a JSON file saved with assessment templates saved that can be loaded and filled out)
